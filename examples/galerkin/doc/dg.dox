\page DG Discontinuous Galerkin

Here we provide the details about the implementation of a Discontinuous Galerkin discretization using GridTools

As in the \ref Galerkin "Finite Element example" we rely on the Intrepid TPL for some of the elemental operations
rewuired in the discretization. We assume in the following that the user is acquaintad with the \ref Galerkin "continuous case".

The complication coming from the DG implementation wrt the continuous case is mostly due to the boundary integrals which have to be performed in order
to compute the fluxes across the elements, e.g.

\f[
    \int_{\partial\hat\Omega_e}{\phi(\hat{\mathbf x})\mathbf n(\hat{\mathbf x})\tilde J(\hat{\mathbf x})}d\hat\Sigma .
\f]

The measure \f$ \tilde J \f$ is the norm of the cross product of the vectors tangent to the surface \f$ \partial \Omega_e \f$ on the current configuration,
