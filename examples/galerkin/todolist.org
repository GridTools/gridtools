* DONE check that the jacobian matrix is correct
* DONE check that the advection matrix is correct
* DONE check that the mass matrix is correct
* DONE check that the stiffness matrix is correct
* DONE check that the boundary matrices have the correct values
* DONE check that the face normals are correct
* DONE paraview export for the vector fields on node
* DONE assembly for the continuous case
* TODO paraview export for the vector fields on faces. Is it possible?
* TODO the quantities living on the faces are oversized, think of a solution
* TODO check that the boundary integrals works with a unit test
* DONE check that the upwind DG flux is correct (compare with DealII)
* TODO implement other fluxes (Lax-Friedrich, Bassi-Rebay, ...)
* TODO Implement a Richardson solver
* TODO how do we impose BCs?
* TODO solve a problem
* TODO think about a smart user-friendly API
* TODO think about generalizations (p refinement!)
