This example demonstrate how to export C bindings using GridTools,
and how to use them from another language.

CMakeLists.txt:           Shows how to use the C bindings generator in the build
                          system.
copy_stencil_wrapper.cpp: The core functionality, exports several functions.
copy_stencil_lib_*:       Those C headers and fortran files are autogenerated
                          files. They are checked in into the repository,
                          in case the code that generates the files cannot be
                          run on each host (in case of cross compiling, the
                          generator binary will be built for the target, and
                          thus, cannot necessarily be executed on the host
                          system).
driver_mc.c               Shows how to call the exported functions from C.
driver_cuda.c             Shows how to call the exported functions from C.
driver.f90                Shows how to call the exported functions from Fortran.
