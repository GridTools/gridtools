If you want to add more gridtools keywords (or remove old ones), search the file highlight.js/highlight.pack.js for an existing gridtools keyword (e.g. make_computation) and add the new keywords there.

The gridtools keyword highlighting is a hack: It uses an existing category "meta" which is not used by the c++ language.
