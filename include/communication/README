Hot to compile GCL:

Modules on CRAY machines (todi)
module add PrgEnv-gnu
module add cmake
module add boost

- run "ccmake ." in the GCL root directory (the one where this README should be)
-- By scrolling with arrow keys you can position to some variable
-- By hitting the "enter" key while on a variable you can set or change the value of the variable
-- By hittinf the "enter" key again after your edits the new value is set
-- By pressing "t" the visualization switch to the extended variable list (THIS IS WHERE YOU FIND THE VARIABLE MENTIONED NEXT)

- On cray machines
-- after loading the appropriare programming environment modules, se the C++ and C compilers to "CC" and "cc" respectively

- hit the "c" key to congigure (this should take a while)

- The boost path variables should be set correctly if the module has been loaded, otherwise set Boost_INCLUDE_DIR to /users/mbianco/boost_1_47_0

- On Cray set the USE_MPI_COMPILER to OFF

- Set GCL_MPI to ON

- Set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE either to DEBUG or RELEASE

- To see what's going on set CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE to ON
