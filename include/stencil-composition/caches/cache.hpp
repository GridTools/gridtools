     * main API class to define caches for particular parameters
     * The cache type is described with a template parameter to the class
     * Caching assumes a parallelization model where all the processing all elements in the vertical dimension are
     * private to each parallel thread,
     * while the processing of grid points in the horizontal plane is executed by different parallel threads.
     * Those caches that cover data in the horizontal (IJ and IJK) are accessed by parallel core units, and
     * therefore require synchronization capabilities (for example shared memory in the GPU), like IJ or IJK caches.
     * On the contrary caches in the K dimension are only accessed by one thread, and therefore resources can be
     * allocated
     * in on-chip without synchronization capabilities (for example registers in GPU)
     * @tparam  cacheType type of cache
     * @tparam Arg argument with parameter being cached
     * @tparam CacheIOPolicy IO policy for cache
