/**
   @file

   @brief File containing the definition of the placeholders used to
   address the storage from whithin the functors.  A placeholder is an
   implementation of the proxy design pattern for the storage class,
   i.e. it is a light object used in place of the storage when
   defining the high level computations, and it will be bound later on
   with a specific instantiation of a storage class.

   Two different types of placeholders are considered:

   - arg represents the storage in the body of the main function, and
     it gets lazily assigned to a real storage.

   - accessor represents the storage inside the functor struct
     containing a Do method. It can be instantiated directly in the Do
     method, or it might be a constant expression instantiated outside
     the functor scope and with static duration.

    /**
       @brief the definition of accessor visible to the user

       \tparam ID the integer unic ID of the field placeholder

       \tparam Extent the extent of i/j indices spanned by the
               placeholder, in the form of <i_minus, i_plus, j_minus,
               j_plus>.  The values are relative to the current
               position. See e.g. horizontal_diffusion::out_function
               as a usage example.

       \tparam Number the number of dimensions accessed by the
               field. Notice that we don't distinguish at this level what we
               call "space dimensions" from the "field dimensions". Both of
               them are accessed using the same interface. whether they are
               field dimensions or space dimension will be decided at the
               moment of the storage instantiation (in the main function)
