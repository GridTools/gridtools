     *
     *  For each type in Res find the element in src of the same type, place those elements in correct order and
     *  construct the Res instance from them.
     *
     *  This utility is handy when we have all elements of the Res, but not in the right order.
     *
     *  Requirements:
     *      - Res and Src should model fusion sequence;
     *      - Res type should have a ctor from a fusion sequence;
     *      - all types from the Res should present in the Src;
     *
     *  Example:
     *      auto what_we_have = boost::fusion::make_vector(42, 80, 'a', .1, "other_stuff", 79, .4);
     *      using what_we_need_t = boost::fusion<char, double, int>;
     *      what_we_need_t expected {'a', .1, 42};
     *      auto actual = permute_to<what_we_need_t>(what_we_have);
     *      EXPECT_EQ(actual, expected);
     *
     * \tparam Res The type of resulting sequence
     * \tparam Res The type of input sequence
     *
     * \param src The input sequence
     * \return The permuted sequence
