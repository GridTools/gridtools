       @brief The following struct defines one specific component of a field
       It contains a direction (compile time constant, specifying the ID of the component),
       and a value (runtime value, which is storing the offset in the given direction).
       As everything what is inside the enumtype namespace, the dimension keyword is
       supposed to be used at the application interface level.
