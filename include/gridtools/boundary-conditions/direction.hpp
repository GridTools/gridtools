       @brief Class defining a direction in a cartesian 3D grid.

       The directions correspond to the following:
       - all the three template parameters are either plus or minus: identifies a node on the cell
       \verbatim
       e.g. direction<minus_, plus_, minus_> corresponds to:
         .____.
        /    /|
       o____. |
       |    | .          z
       |    |/       x__/
       .____.           |
                        y
       \endverbatim

       - there is one zero parameter: identifies one edge
       \verbatim
       e.g. direction<zero_, plus_, minus_> corresponds to:
         .____.
        /    /|
       .####. |
       |    | .
       |    |/
       .____.
       \endverbatim

       - there are 2 zero parameters: identifies one face
       \verbatim
       e.g. direction<zero_, zero_, minus_> corresponds to:
         .____.
        /    /|
       .____. |
       |####| .
       |####|/
       .####.
       \endverbatim
       - the case in which all three are zero does not belong to the boundary and is excluded.
