        encountered, while the Binary operator if used to "accumulate" to and
        initial value the results obtained by the unary operator. This is
        basically a map-reduce on the esf_descriptors of a computation.  The
        binary operator is assumed need to be at least associative (the order
        of the visit is the program order).

        The binary op is not actually binary, but accepts extra variadic
        arguments, of which only two will be used. The reason is to make
        boost::mpl::and_ and boost::mpl::or_ metafunctions working
        with this construct.
