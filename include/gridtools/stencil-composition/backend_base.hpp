   @brief base class for all the backends. Current supported backend are \ref gridtools::enumtype::Host and \ref

    /**
        this struct contains the 'run' method for all backends, with a
        policy determining the specific type. Each backend contains a
        traits class for the specific case.

        backend<type, strategy>
        there are traits: one for type and one for strategy.
        - type refers to the architecture specific, like the
          differences between cuda and the host.

        The backend has a member function "run" that is called by the
        "intermediate".
        The "run" method calls strategy_from_id<strategy>::loop

        - the strategy_from_id is in the specific backend_? folder, such as
        - in backend_?/backend_traits.h

        - strategy_from_id contains the tile size information and the
        - "struct loop" which has the "run_loop" member function.

        Before calling the loop::run_loop method, the backend queries
        "execute_traits" that are contained in the
        "backend_traits_t". the latter is obtained by

        backend_strategy_from_id<type>

        The execute_traits::backend_t (bad name) is responsible for
        the "inner loop nests". The
        loop<execute_traits::backend_t>::run_loop will use that to do
        whatever he has to do, for instance, the host_backend will
        iterate over the functors of the MSS using the for_each
        available there.

        - Similarly, the definition (specialization) is contained in the
        - specific subfoled (right now in backend_?/backend_traits_?.h ).

        - This contains:
        - - (INTERFACE) pointer<>::type that returns the first argument to instantiate the storage class
        - - (INTERFACE) storage_traits::storage_t to get the storage type to be used with the backend
        - - (INTERFACE) execute_traits ?????? this was needed when backend_traits was forcely shared between host and
       cuda backends. Now they are separated and this may be simplified.
        - - (INTERNAL) for_each that is used to invoke the different things for different stencils in the MSS
        - - (INTERNAL) once_per_block
