    /**@brief API for a runtime switch between several multi stage stencils

       Its implementation is recursive. It creates as many boolean conditionals as
       the number of \ref gridtools::case_ defined, and it implements the switch in terms of
       \ref gridtools::if_ constructs. The unique ID which is necessary in order to define the boolean
       conditionals in this case is assigned automatically by the library (as a very large number)

       \tparam Cond must be a nullary integer functor.
       \tparam First must be an instance of @ref gridtools::case_type
       \tparam Cases must be instances of @ref gridtools::case_type, or @ref gridtools::default_type fir the last one

       \param cond_ an instance of type Cond
       \param first_ the first case
       \param cases_ the pack of cases, the last one being the default_ one

       NOTE: multiple switch statements can coexist in the same computation,
       and the arbitrary nesting of switch_ statements are supported.


       example of usage:
@verbatim
auto c1 = []{ return 3; }

auto computation_ = make_computation(
    switch_(
        c1
        , case_(1, make_mss(...))
        , case_(2, make_mss(...))
        , case_(3, make_mss(...))
        , default_(make_mss(...))
    )
);

computation->ready();
computation->steady();
computation->run(); // run the 3rd case
reset_conditional(c1, c2);
computation->run(); // run the first case
computation->finalize();
@endverbatim
