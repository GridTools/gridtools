         * private to each parallel thread,

         * Those caches that cover data in the horizontal (IJ and IJK) are accessed by parallel core units, and
         * therefore require synchronization capabilities (for example shared memory in the GPU), like IJ or IJK caches.
         * On the contrary caches in the K dimension are only accessed by one thread, and therefore resources can be

         * in on-chip without synchronization capabilities (for example registers in GPU)
