     * get_k_interval specialization for parallel execution policy. The full k-axis is split into equally-sized block
     * sub-intervals and assigned to the blocks in z-direction. Each block iterates over all computation intervals and
     * calculates the subinterval which intersects with the block sub-interval.
     *
     * Example with with an axis with four intervals, that is distributed among 2 blocks:
     *
     * Computation intervals   block sub-intervals
     *                           with two blocks
