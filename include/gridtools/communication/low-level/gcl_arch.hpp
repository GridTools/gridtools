/** \file
    In this file the different types of architectures are
    defined. The Architectures specifies where the data to be
    exchanged by communication patterns are residing. The possible
    choices are: \link gridtools::gcl_cpu \endlink , \link gridtools::gcl_gpu
    \endlink , end, for illustration purpose only, \link gridtools::gcl_mc
    \endlink , which is not supported at the moment.

    The assumption is that data to be exchanged is in the same place
    for all the processes involved in a pattern. That is, it is not
    possible to send data from a cpu main memory to a remote GPU
    memory.
