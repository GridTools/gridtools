cinclude2dot is a perl tool that allows us to identify circular dependencies in the C++ include files.

The tool requires the path to the include files and generates a graphviz .dot, that we can later analize
in order to generate strongly connected components. 

Instructions on how to run the tool to detect the circular dependencies follow:

$ perl cinclude2dot --src include/  > graph.dot
# Decompose directed graph into strongly connected components (circular dependencies)
$ sccmap -v graph.dot  >& circ_graph.dot
# Generate pdf
$ dot -Tpdf circ_graph.dot -o circ_graph.pdf
