/*
 * This example demonstrates how to retrieve the connectivity information of the
 * icosahedral/octahedral grid in the user functor. This is useful for example when
 * we need to operate on fields with a double location, for which the on_cells, on_edges
 * syntax has limitations, as it requires make use of the eval object, which is not
 * resolved in the lambdas passed to the on_cells syntax.
 * The example shown here computes a value for each edge of a cells. Therefore the primary
 * location type of the output field is cells, however we do not store a scalar value, but
 * a value per edge of each cell (i.e. 3 values).
 * The storage is therefore a 5 dimensional field with indices (i, c, j, k, edge_number)
 * where the last has the range [0,2]
