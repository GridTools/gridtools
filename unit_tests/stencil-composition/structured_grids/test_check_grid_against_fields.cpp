       Testing the check of bounds for iteration spaces.

       The first three arguments are the sizes of the storages, the
       second three are the sizes of the grid.

       If the sizes would be ok for a computation to run, then the
       check will not throw an exception. In this case the last
       argument will be returned to the caller. If the sizes make the
       check to fail, then the returned value if the negation of the
       last argument. This is why, the test is given a `true` if the
       test is assumed to pass, and a `false` if it assumed to
       fail. In this way we can test both cases, the failing and the
       successful.
